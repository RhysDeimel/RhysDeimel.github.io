<!-- SUMMARY -->
---

Update spellcheck config to ignore code blocks.
By default python markdown does not recognise fenced code by default:
https://codesti.com/issue/facelessuser/pyspelling/156#168826773

To fix this, we enable the fenced code extension.

// TODO - should also make a PR to the pyspelling project to update their docs
